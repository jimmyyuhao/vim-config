Installation
Do I need to install pip?

pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org or if you are working in a Virtual Environment created by virtualenv or pyvenv. Just make sure to upgrade pip.
Installing with get-pip.py

To install pip, securely download get-pip.py. [1]:

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

Then run the following:

python get-pip.py
